                    A lab-grown diamond is like a natural diamond mined under the earth's crust. They have similar
                    physical and chemical properties and are grown under the same conditions of temperature and
                    pressure. However, the price of Lab-grown diamonds is only 50% of the price of natural diamonds.
                    This means that for the same price you have a chance to own a Lab-grown diamond that is 2 times the
                    size of a natural diamond of the same quality. However, the price of Lab-grown diamonds is only 50%
